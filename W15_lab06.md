The README.md is not in good shape, does not give a good description of what the program does. It also does not contain any directions on how to run or play the game.

The "ant -p" command only outputs the description for one task, "linenumbers", which creates a file containing all source files with line numbers. 

The code compiles and runs successfully. However, the only game that is implemented is TicTacToe. The chat/message system seems to work correctly. 

The "issues" involve fixing the README and the build.xml file are more along the lines of "Low Hanging Fruit", whereas implementing the other two games is a much more consuming task. The source code for the games has basically already been done in the previous version of the program, but now needs to be implemented using the new MVC setup.
